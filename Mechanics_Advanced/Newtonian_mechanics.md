# Newtonian mechanics
## Equilibrium equations
Each degree of freedom needs to be balanced.
$$\sum F = 0$$
## Solve the equations of motion

$$F = ma$$

$$v = \int\frac{F}{m} dt$$

$$s(t) = \int vdt = \int\int\frac{F}{m} dt^2$$
## Analytical Mechanics Evolution
1. Newtonian mechanics : Must handle all reaction forces; prone to errors as the system becomes complex.
1. Lagrangian mechanics : Automatically eliminates constraint reaction forces through generalized coordinates and energy forms.
1. Hamiltonian mechanics : Rewrites second-order differential equations into first-order canonical equations, resulting in a clearer structure suitable for theoretical analysis.
1. Hamilton–Jacobi mechanics : Through canonical transformations, transforms the dynamic problem into solving for a single action function, allowing the equations of motion to be directly obtained by integration under ideal conditions.
