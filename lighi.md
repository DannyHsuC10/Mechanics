# Light
* Speed of light $C \approx 300,000km/s$
* Waveâ€“particle duality
## Characteristic of light
* Scattering
Blue light is more scattered than rad light

* Diffraction
$d	=$	distance between slits
$\theta	=$	diffraction angle
$n	=$	order number for the maximum
$\lambda	=$	wavelength
$$d \sin \theta=n \lambda$$

* Reflection
$$\theta_i = \theta_r$$

* Refraction
$n_1	=$	incident index
$n_2	=$	refracted index
$\theta_1	=$	incident angle
$\theta_2	=$	refracted angle
$$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$

* Dispersion

| Light  | Wavelength | Energy |
|:------:|:----------:|:------:|
|  Red   |   Large    | Small  |
| Purple |   Small    | Large  |

* Diffusion
Diffuse reflection obeys the law of reflection
