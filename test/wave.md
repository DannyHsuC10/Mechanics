# Wave
## Period & frequency
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

$$f = v/Î»$$

## Decibel
$$dB=10\times log_{10}(\frac{P}{P_{ref}})$$

$P =$ sound pressure
$P_{ref} =$ refer sound pressure

## Characteristic of wave

* Reflection : 
Reflection happens when a wave bounces off a surface and changes direction. 

* Refraction : 
Refraction is the bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another.

* Diffraction : 
Diffraction happens when a wave encounters an obstacle.

* Scattering : 
Scattering is the process by which waves are deflected in various directions when they interact with a surface.
