# Equilibrium of rigid bodies

## Equilibrium of a rigid body in two dimension

In this case, forces are all in xy plane.
$$F_z = 0 \qquad M_x = M_y = 0$$

equations of equilibrium :

$$\sum F_{xi} = 0 \qquad \sum F_{yi} = 0$$

$$\sum M_z = 0$$

## statically indeterminate reactions partial constraints

a rigid body is improperly constrained whenever the supports are arranged in such a way that the reactions must be either concurrent or parallel.
Then the equation is not enough to solve the unknown.

## Equilibrium of a twe-force body

if the two-force body is in equilibrium, the two forces must have the same magnitude, same line of action, and opposite direction.
$$F_A = F_B$$

## Equilibrium of a three-force body

if the three force body is in equilibrium, the line of action of the three forces must be either concurrent or parallel.

## Equilibrium of a rigid body in three dimension

equations of equilibrium :
$$\sum F_i = 0$$

$$\sum F_{xi} = \sum F_{yi} = \sum F_{zi} = 0$$

$$\sum M_i = 0$$

$$\sum M_{xi} = \sum M_{yi} = \sum M_{zi} = 0$$
