# Centroids and Centers of Gravity
## Areas and lines
Divide the part into n small elements.
$$W = \sum_{i=1}^n\Delta W_i$$

$$\bar xW = \sum_{i=1}^nx_i\Delta W_i$$

$$\bar yW = \sum_{i=1}^ny_i\Delta W_i$$
Increase the number of elements.
$$\bar xW = \int xdW$$

$$\bar yW = \int ydW$$
## Centroids of areas and lines
**Areas**
$$\Delta W=\rho gt\Delta A$$
* density of material : $\rho$
* acceleration of gravity : $g$
* thichness : $t$
* area of element : $\Delta A$
$$W = \rho gtA$$

$$\bar xW = \int xdW = \int x\rho gtdA$$

$$\bar x\rho gtA = \rho gt\int xdA$$

$$\bar xA = \int xdA$$
***
**lines**
$$\Delta W = \rho gA\Delta L$$

$$\bar xL = \int xdL$$

$$\bar yL = \int ydL$$
## Composite plates and wires
$$\bar x_{tt} = \frac{\sum W_ix_i}{\sum W_i}$$

$$\bar y_{tt} = \frac{\sum W_iy_i}{\sum W_i}$$

## Theorems of pappus-guldinus
1. **First theorem** 
The surface area of a surface of revolution is the product of the length of the curve and the distance traveled by its centroid.
The surface area is generated by rotating a plane curve around an axis that doesn't intersect the curve.
![Theorems of pappus-guldinus1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1B98Xe5ye.png)

$$A = 2\pi\bar yL$$

$$dA = 2\pi ydL$$

$$A = \int dA = \int2\pi ydL$$

$$= 2\pi \int ydL = 2\pi\bar yL$$
2. **Second theorem** 
The volume of a solid of revolution is the product of the generating area and the distance traveled by its centroid.
The volume is generated by revolving a plane area around an axis that doesn't intersect the area.

$$V =\pi\bar yA$$

$$dV = 2\pi ydA$$

$$V = \int dV = \int2\pi ydV$$

$$= 2\pi\int ydA = 2\pi\bar yA$$
## Forces on  submerged surface
$$bP = b\rho gh$$

* pressure : $P$
* density : $\rho$
* acceleration of gravity : $g$
* height : $h$
* width :ã€€$b$
* Force at this width : $P\cdot b$
## Center of gravity of 3D body
$$dW = \rho gdW$$

$$\bar rW = \rho g\int rdV$$

$$\bar xW = \rho g\int xdV$$

$$\bar yW = \rho g\int ydV$$

$$\bar zW = \rho g\int zdV$$

$$dV = dx\ dy\ dz$$
