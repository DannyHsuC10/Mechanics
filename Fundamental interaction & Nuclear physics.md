# Fundamental interaction & Nuclear physics
## State

| state  | velocity | temperature |
|:------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
| solid  |   low    |     low     |
| liquid |  medium  |   medium    |
|  gas   |   high   |    high     |

* Solid:
At low temperatures, matter is in a solid state. The molecular motion is low, with molecules mainly vibrating in fixed positions.

* Liquid:
As the temperature increases, matter enters a liquid state. The molecular motion is moderate, allowing molecules to move freely within a small range.

* Gas:
With further increase in temperature, matter becomes gaseous. The molecular motion is high, and molecules move freely throughout the entire container, with fast and widely distributed velocities.

**interaction**
* Strong interaction
Maintain stability within the nucleus
* Weak interaction
nuclear reaction

**energy**
Atomic mass $\simeq$ Nucleus mass $\simeq$ Nuclear energy
$$E = mc^2$$
