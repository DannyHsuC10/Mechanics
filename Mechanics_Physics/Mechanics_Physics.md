# Mechanics (Physics)

## [Classic](Classic/Classic.md)
Describing the motion of objects such as projectiles, parts of machinery, spacecraft, planets, stars, galaxies, deformable solids, fluids, macromolecules and other objects. 
## [Fluid & Gas & Heat & statistic](Fluid_Gas_Heat_statistic/Fluid_Gas_Heat_statistic.md)
Describing heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and combustion. Discussing the overall impact rather than the motion of a single object
## [SHM](SHM/SHM.md)
SHM is a special type of periodic motion an object experiences by means of a restoring force whose magnitude is directly proportional to the distance of the object from an equilibrium position and acts towards the equilibrium position. 
## [Modern](Modern/Modern.md)
