# Linear motion

## Moving distance
* Stationary or moving?
The object is not moving : $x_{initial} = x_{final}$
The object moved　: $x_{initial} \not= x_{final}$

* Displacement & path
Displacement : Displacement is the magnitude (length) of the displacement vector.
Path : Path length is how far the object moved as it traveled from its initial position to its final position.


## Velocity
Velocity is slope of position versus time.

$$V_{avg} = \frac{Δx}{Δt} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}$$

$$V = \lim_{{Δt \to 0}}\frac{Δx}{Δt} = \frac{dx}{dt}$$

* Speed & Velocity
Velocity is a vector but speed is a scalar.

$$speed = \frac{path}{time} \qquad velocity = \frac{Displacement}{time}$$


## Acceleration
Acceleration is slope of velocity versus time.

$$a_{avg} = \frac{ΔV}{Δt} = \frac{V_f-V_i}{t_f-t_i}$$

$$a = \lim_{{Δt \to 0}}\frac{ΔV}{Δt} = \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$


## Relationship between position, velocity and acceleration
* if a is a constant

$$V = V_i+at$$

$$x_f-x_i = V_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$

$$V_f^2 = V_i^2+2a(X_f-X_i)$$

$$x_f-x_i = \frac{1}{2}(V_i+V_f)⋅t$$

$$x_f-x_i = V_ft-\frac{1}{2}at^2$$

$$a = \frac{V_f-V_i}{t}$$

* When free falling
$x_i = 0 \qquad V_i = 0 \qquad a = g$

$$x_f = x_i+V_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2 ⇒ h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$

## Differentiation and Integration
The integral of acceleration with respect to time is velocity.
The integral of velocity with respect to time is position.

$$a = \frac{dV}{dt} \qquad V = ∫adt$$

$$V = at+V_i$$

$$x = \frac{dV}{dt} \qquad x = ∫Vdt = ∫(at+V_i)dt$$

$$x =  x_i+V_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
